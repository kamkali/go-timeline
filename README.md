# Go Timeline
This is the first part of the ZAI course project.

The "go-timeline" project is a backend for the timeline project.
Includes the REST API and storage for the system.

Right now, the frontend part is very much simplified and allows only for a simple app preview.

The app is deployed on [Heroku](https://go-timeline.herokuapp.com/).
Because it's hosted on free plan, please keep in mind the app can take a while to load.

In the following, second part, the more robust frontend will be implemented and presented.

## TODO
* Tests
  * Unit
  * E2E
* Robust Frontend
  * Better "Process" entity displaying
* Expose /api/ routes on UI
